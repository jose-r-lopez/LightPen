# LightPen
Lightpen mobile pentesting tool V1.1



## Sources and binaries

The last stable version of the source code and its binaries are available in the [releases](https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/LightPen/releases) section.

To import the project in Android Studio, just download the sources and unzip them in any folder you like. Then, you just have to use the "Import project" option
and locate the folder "Lightpen-master" to import it. Android Studio sometimes gives problems with long routes or with folder permisssions, therefore is 
recommendable to use a suitable route to unpack the sources.

Testing from Android Studio have been done with an Emulated Google Pixel XL (Android 7.0, API 24). Newer versions should work without problems.
